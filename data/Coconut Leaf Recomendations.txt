# Coconut Leaf Pest-related Disease Knowledge Base
# Covering 5 categories: Leaflet Damage, Caterpillar Infestation, Yellowing, Drying, Flaccidity

==================================================
DISEASE: Leaflet Damage
--------------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
- Brown streaks, cuts, or notches on leaflets.
- Caused mainly by beetles, grasshoppers, or minor chewing pests.
- Affects young fronds more severely.

Chemical Pesticide Recommendations:
- Neem-based formulations (Azadirachtin 0.15%) at 5 ml/L water, sprayed in the evening.
- In severe beetle damage: Quinalphos 25 EC @ 2 ml/L water, applied as spot spray.
- If grasshopper outbreak: Malathion 50 EC @ 2 ml/L water.

Fertilizer Recommendations:
- Organic manure: 25–30 kg well-decomposed compost or farmyard manure per tree annually.
- NPK (per year per adult palm): 500 g Urea + 700 g MOP + 250 g TSP (in split doses).
- Foliar spray of micronutrients (Zn, Mg) for damaged fronds.

Homemade / Organic Practices:
- Spray neem oil solution (30 ml neem oil + 5 g soap in 1 L water).
- Apply cow dung slurry around palm base for soil health.
- Ash-water spray (100 g wood ash boiled in 2 L water, cooled, filtered, and sprayed) to deter minor insects.

Preventive / Cultural Practices:
- Maintain field sanitation (remove weeds and debris).
- Encourage natural predators (ladybird beetles, spiders).
- Avoid overcrowding of palms to reduce insect breeding.

Safety Notes:
- Always spray pesticides during evening hours.
- Rotate chemical groups to avoid resistance buildup.

==================================================
DISEASE: Caterpillar Infestation
--------------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
- Irregular holes on leaflets, with greenish-black droppings (frass).
- Caterpillars feed at night; severe damage reduces photosynthesis.

Chemical Pesticide Recommendations:
- Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 4 g/10 L water.
- Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 0.3 ml/L water.
- For large infestations: Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 1 ml/L water.

Biological Control:
- Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) @ 1 g/L water, sprayed on young fronds.
- Release egg parasitoid *Trichogramma chilonis* (50,000/acre).

Fertilizer Recommendations:
- Apply NPK balance: 500 g Urea + 1 kg MOP/tree/year.
- Foliar spray of 1% potassium nitrate to strengthen leaf tissue.
- Vermicompost (10 kg/tree/year) improves tree resistance.

Homemade / Organic Practices:
- Light trap at night to attract and kill adult moths.
- Spray garlic-chili extract (50 g garlic + 50 g chili paste in 1 L water, fermented 24 hrs, diluted 1:10) on infested leaves.
- Coconut oil + soap spray (10 ml oil + 5 g soap in 1 L water) suffocates caterpillars.

Preventive / Cultural Practices:
- Remove and burn severely infested fronds.
- Monitor at night with torchlight to catch early infestations.
- Encourage birds (mynahs, king crows) as natural predators.

Safety Notes:
- Avoid spraying Bt in strong sunlight (best applied in evening).
- Follow label instructions for chemical pesticides.

==================================================
DISEASE: Yellowing
--------------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
- Older leaves turn yellow from tips to base.
- May be due to nutrient deficiency, poor drainage, or pest pressure.
- Prolonged yellowing reduces nut yield.

Fertilizer Recommendations:
- Apply Muriate of Potash (MOP) 1 kg/tree/year in 2–3 splits.
- Magnesium Sulphate 500 g/tree/year if magnesium deficiency is present.
- Foliar spray: 2% urea + 1% MgSO4 during visible yellowing.
- Organic manure: 25–30 kg compost/tree/year.

Pesticide / Soil Amendment (if pest-related):
- If yellowing due to root grubs: Apply Chlorpyriphos 20 EC @ 5 ml/L as soil drench.
- Neem cake @ 2 kg/tree mixed in soil to suppress grubs and enrich nutrients.

Homemade / Organic Practices:
- Banana pseudostem mulch around root zone to improve soil potassium.
- Fermented cow urine solution (1 L fermented cow urine + 9 L water) foliar sprayed to boost nutrient uptake.
- Wood ash (rich in potash) sprinkled near roots.

Preventive / Cultural Practices:
- Maintain good drainage, avoid waterlogging.
- Intercrop with legumes to enrich soil nitrogen.
- Mulch with green leaves and coconut husks to conserve moisture.

Safety Notes:
- Avoid over-fertilization; excess salts can worsen yellowing.
- Always apply fertilizers 0.5–1 m away from the trunk in circular basins.

==================================================
DISEASE: Drying of Leaflets
--------------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
- Leaf tip browning progressing towards midrib.
- In severe cases, entire leaflet dries and withers.
- Often linked to mite infestation, drought, or potassium deficiency.

Chemical Pesticide Recommendations:
- Dicofol 18.5% EC @ 5 ml/L water for mite management.
- Propargite 57 EC @ 2 ml/L as alternative acaricide.
- For persistent cases: Wettable Sulphur 80 WP @ 2 g/L water.

Fertilizer Recommendations:
- Apply 1 kg MOP/tree/year in 2–3 splits.
- Foliar spray: 1% KNO3 solution twice in 15-day interval.
- Add 30 kg organic manure + 500 g bone meal/tree annually.

Homemade / Organic Practices:
- Spray soap solution (10 g detergent in 1 L water) to suppress mites.
- Apply diluted buttermilk (200 ml in 10 L water) on leaf surface to reduce drying.
- Mulch with coconut husk to retain soil moisture.

Preventive / Cultural Practices:
- Irrigate regularly in dry season.
- Maintain soil moisture with mulching.
- Rotate acaricides to prevent resistance.

Safety Notes:
- Avoid overuse of acaricides; follow a rotation schedule.
- Do not spray sulphur in very hot conditions (>32°C).

==================================================
DISEASE: Flaccidity
--------------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
- Leaves become soft, droop downward, lose turgidity.
- Caused by root stress, nematode damage, or waterlogging.
- Reduces nutrient absorption and weakens palm.

Chemical / Soil Pesticide Recommendations:
- Apply Carbofuran granules 3G @ 1 kg/tree in soil around root zone (use caution).
- For nematode infestation: Neem cake @ 2 kg/tree + Paecilomyces lilacinus (biocontrol fungus).
- Drench soil with Carbendazim 0.1% if fungal root rot suspected.

Fertilizer Recommendations:
- Apply 20–25 kg Farm Yard Manure (FYM)/tree annually.
- NPK recommendation: 500 g Urea + 1 kg MOP + 500 g TSP/tree/year.
- Foliar spray of 2% urea for quick nitrogen uptake.

Homemade / Organic Practices:
- Apply compost tea (vermicompost soaked in water for 2 days, filtered, sprayed) for soil health.
- Use turmeric powder + cow urine solution (20 g turmeric in 1 L cow urine + 9 L water, root drench) for root-strengthening.
- Mulch with banana leaves or straw to conserve moisture.

Preventive / Cultural Practices:
- Improve field drainage to avoid water stagnation.
- Avoid continuous monocropping; intercrop with legumes.
- Regular soil loosening around root zone for aeration.

Safety Notes:
- Carbofuran is toxic – handle with gloves, avoid exposure.
- Prefer bio-nematicides where possible for sustainability.
